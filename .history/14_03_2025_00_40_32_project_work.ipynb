    "This semester our DSCI-100 course has the fortunate opportunity of getting to work with two real and unique data sets provided by Frank Wood’s computer science research team. Each data set, labeled `players_data` and `sessions_data` respectively, contains distinct information on individual player characteristics and statistics on gaming habits while playing on the research team’s custom MineCraft server. Information was collected for `players_data` during each user’s sign-up and was also updated in the `played_hours` column as users continued to log more hours on the server. `sessions_data` has also been updated dynamically throughout the server’s lifespan and consists of the login and log out information for each user. \n",
